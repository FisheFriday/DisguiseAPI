# DisguiseAPI

Disguise is an open-source API which solves manipulating with player skins in Minecraft using NMS.
<br>
The standard Bukkit/Spigot implementation does not provide support for changing skins, so using this API
<br>
you can easily control player skins.

The goal for this plugin is to handle all versions in range from: **1.7 - LATEST (1.19 now)**.
Currently, it has handlers for `1.8.8, 1.9.4, 1.10 releases, 1.11 releases`
